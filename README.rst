Overview
========

These tools allow me to activate confirmation of SSH agent identities while
meeting the following objectives:

- Password protected SSH identities
- SSH identity passwords stored in Mac OS X Keychain
- Absolute minimum install:
  - Do not overwrite or replace executables
  - Do not require compiling or Xcode


Installation
============

1. Symlink ``ssh-askpass.sh`` to ``/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass``.
   (The ``install.sh`` script does this.)
2. It may be convenient to put ``ssh_add_confirm_ids.sh`` in your ``PATH``.


Use
===

1. Add identities to your Mac OS X Keychain via ``ssh-add -K``
2. Prior to connecting to any hosts, execute ``ssh_add_confirm_ids.sh``

   - In the interest of security, do **not** Always Allow security access to
     your keychain

3. Repeat step 3 each time you log into your Mac
