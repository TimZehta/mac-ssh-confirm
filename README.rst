Overview
========

One way to help protect against `SSH Agent Hijacking`_ is by confirming each
use of the of the decrypted identities managed by ``ssh-agent``.

These tools allow confirmation while (still) meeting the following objectives:

- Password protected SSH identities
- SSH identity passwords stored in Mac OS X Keychain

  - Passwords do not need to be entered again and again.

- Absolute minimum install:

  - Do not overwrite or replace executables
  - Do not require compiling or Xcode

Additionally, configuration of SSH to use ``ControlMaster`` connections, will
keep things unobtrusive.

This is a useful hack. More useful would be development by Apple to support
SSH Agent confirmations.

Installation
============

1. Symlink ``ssh-askpass.sh`` to ``/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass``.
   (The ``install.sh`` script does this.)
2. It may be convenient to put ``ssh_add_confirm_ids.sh`` in your PATH.


Use
===

1. Add identities to your Mac OS X Keychain via ``ssh-add -K``
2. Prior to connecting to any hosts, execute ``ssh_add_confirm_ids.sh``

   - In the interest of security, do **not** Always Allow security access to
     your keychain

3. Repeat the step above each time you log into your Mac
